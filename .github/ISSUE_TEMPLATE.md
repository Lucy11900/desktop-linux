************************************************************************************
*READ ME FIRST*

This repository is for reporting bugs with the Docker Desktop for Linux software,
which we respond to on a best-effort basis.

Do *not* paste logfiles into github issues: upload diagnostics instead, which are
only visible to Docker engineers.

community support is available from the Docker community Slack (https://www.docker.com/docker-community).

Issues without sufficient detail to debug them will be closed. They generally need
a clear title and description, steps to reproduce, and a diagnostics ID. See
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/troubleshoot/#diagnose-and-feedback for
how to generate a diagnostics ID either from inside the app or from the command line.
